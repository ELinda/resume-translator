1. Use one of the exporters listed on https://jsonresume.org/projects/ -- I used the LinkedIn parsing Chrome extension
2. Run code in resume.ipynb -- This can be opened in a Jupyter notebook with a Python 3 kernel, or run in a separate file. Change filename to match the relevant one.
3. Paste the printed output into another notebook, with a markdown cell (press "m" while a cell is selected, but its text area isn't in focus, to convert cell type from code to markdown)
4. Click on File -> Save Notebook As -> HTML
5. Open the PDF in Chrome, and press Cmd + P (Mac) or Ctrl + P to print and select "PDF" as the target.
